## 1. Project Overview 
### Problem Area
Cyber crime is on an upwards trajectory and with Generative AI tools becoming readily accessible to anyone with an internet connection, it's only a matter of time before even the laziest of scammers start fooling us. It's not difficult to imagine that large corporations have the IT infrastructure and man power to protect their employees from cyber threats, but what about Small to Medium Businesses (SMB's)? According to a cyber crime study by Accenture, 43% of all cyber attacks are on SMB's and as stated by the World Economic Forum, 95% of all cyber breaches are attributed to human error. 

So why don't we just get anti-virus & anti-malware security and call it a day? Well, security is like an onion, the more layers of security you have, the more protected you are. Common security suites like McAfee, Bitbolid, and Sentinal 1 are good for stopping threats after mistakes were made, but what if we can avoid committing the mistake completely? This is where building a system that predicts whether a URL is legitimate or a phishing attempt provide immeasuarable value. It's that extra layer of security that helps protect SMB's from total ruin. 
### Who's The Victim in All of This? 
As mentioned above, SMB's are the most vulnerble, due to various factors like, lack of education on the subject matter, cannot afford paying for
